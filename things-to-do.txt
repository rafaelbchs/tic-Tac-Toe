GAME SPECS

As users playing a two player game we want to:

enter our names and have them displayed
have our order chosen for us by the game
take turns placing our marks in empty spaces
not be able to place our marks in an occupied space
be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
start the game over without having to reset the browser

As a user playing a one player game I want to:

see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space

As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)

THINGS I NEED TO DO 

1. Crear la logica final del juego (Jugadores X y O). Como el sudoku validator
Trabajar con Arrays como en el Sudoku, 3 de cada tipo gana.
2. Crear la interface del juego, como se ve. Cosas que tiene que tener:
- Jugar Solo o contra otra persona
- Introducir el nombre del / de los Jugadores
- Mostrarlos en la pantalla
- Escoger RANDOM quien va primero y quien va despues
- Si hay 3 de cada una, decir quien gano. Si no, mostrar draw
- Poder reiniciar el juego por la pantalla
-Hacer que la computadora tenga dos modos, Facil o Dificil
-Poder aumentar el tamano del tablero
